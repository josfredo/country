		The fireplace shimmers in wild unrest
		In the clouds one can sin unharmed
		The kitchen table covers us from horror
		It helps us not discern whats best

		For best is best described as foul
		It separates, discards and no,
		We can't afford to be unchained
		Who's gonna catch you when I fall?

		The fireplace is controlled pitfire
		It could burn you, but does not desire
		Go away, go away desire!
		We are safe and hired

I take for granted the greatness of your sight.</q><br><br>
