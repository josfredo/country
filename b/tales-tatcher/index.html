      Fundamentally burned were the once flaming hearts, for passion became an excuse rather than pure fuel.<br><br>
Utah was last. All the other cities were vivian black in soul, experiential dust and ashes in practice. But Utah, it resisted. And when Elise and I arrived at the nameless fast-food shop and saw the impossible couple in a whimsically hazy ritual, it seemed that love would be the ultimate healer. Eventually we realized, not after a few seconds of awe, how stupid of an idea that was. I took my unweeping knife, made fully of neurons and reason, and killed them both.<br><br>
Just kidding. We kept the sister, Tessa, as a hostage. Left my body to fuse with Utah’s fate. Mine is a monopoly, I said, and monopoly is one.<br><br>
“Whatever you think this is, that’s a lie”, Tessa protested in teenage fashion. The feeling was not mutual, but the idea was. Anyways, we put her on sedatives. And for the record, I didn’t kill Tessa only because Elise opposed. I was curious on why, but so lost in Utah’s figure. The fiction balsamo, the vibe’s coercion, the souls unbreakable. Latter was us.

      Who’s responsible? Why, hello there. I believe. Rockety risky business. Forward, it is. Corrosion devours. Make me a clones. Give us a tons of clones. Duplicate my soul. Triumph of a cause. Needs to. Did I met you? Have we ever met, Ollie?<br><br>
Do I know you, I think to ask. When the hamburgers taste of a frivolous rush, that’s where I belong. Would, I, shower you of questions. You, mine, the longest of longs. I’m using my lungs to write you love songs. Fond of you. I am fond of you. I admire you. I would so ravage to adore you.<br><br>
North american skies. Almost. Why, oh well. Dang, a flash of… what? I envision of the iconic and everlasting haze of us. The kind of haze that wasn’t, but whose ideal nature is so strong that, even if unreal, I feel it. I have feelings for our times.<br><br>
So now I remind myself of the letters I wrote, but never sent. For I was addressing them to a mind-archived you. It wasn’t really you. Yet it fucking was.<br><br>
So I remind myself of your unkowningness of english. To think, to imagine, to fantasize of me being a teacher of yours. Just if. My lack of teaching skills all displayed in ambivalent fashion to the you. The you, as only and─(!!!)─special.<br><br>
Mine is a fight for the basic principles, for decency. And you, oh darling. You have changed my life, oh yea, oh yeah-ah. Let’s leave behind bad memories, vamos a jugar.<br><br>
“Childish”, I assume to hear from you. I never understood you. Did you? Don’t think you even took a chance to. Well I was wrong all along about you. You see, the distance between who we were and what we’re now can make funny things to memory. I don’t care. You don’t care. It’s ok. I’m over you. I just have sudden seldom parodies of collapses. For I’ve been waiting for you.<br><br>
It wasn’t you. Sad, it seems now. But not for long. If it was you, you would have waited for me.<br><br>
Not you.<br><br>
Me.

      “So yea.” Jake added, “All my whereabouts were lost and, we assume, forgiven. Then, a jubilee of clouds gave an uprising welcome to few of solar rays. It swung very retro, vintage metro, veil electro. That’s my recall, anyways”.<br><br>
Jake Landa, an average-looking highschool boy, in a room with two men in suits. The room was hella hobo. Mid-on lights and flickering ones hanging from above. Discoloured velvet fabrics of red and green and blue governed the dissonant vibes.<br><br>
“Huh”, one suit finally mumbled.<br><br>
“All I do is translate”, Jake continued. “What I’m reading certainly makes no sense. I sense pretentious, hence I’m anxious to help in any way. So what d’you say?”.<br>
Jake was reading from a pile of letters the suits gave him. There had been some amateur car bombings.

      <div id="400" class="subt center strong">Blue Halo</div>
      <br>
      Of dirty maniacs. Of homeless bastards. Of vapid sperma post-hate.<br><br>
I’ve read the tales of bloodful warriors, those who embraced infamy and creamed joy. My aims differ, but for the most part I did believe the shot was genuine. As appointments disappear, I rediscover there’s only “us by me”.<br><br>
Blue halo, golden rage. Mellow grin, high hopes. What did you do to your face? What did you do to our haze?<br><br>
Dirt, dirt, the dirtiest and flames. Under an elegant firmament, or under a ceiling of rust of the bad kind? Rust’s a witness; and the fume is of abominable… ugh.<br><br>
In you I trusted. The chance is lost.

      Her wings entangling. Juvenile of the week, anti-rage & anti-nymph.<br>
Or maybe not. As whatever: the influx’s done.<br>
For all the things that I’ve done.<br><br>
Besides, I still love you.

      <br>
      Cristal is the victim. She wore that tag every friday night, wednesday afternoon, thursday light round pixel aura borealis.<br>
“It’s always the other way ’round”, a woman in the room says.<br>
He tries to process her words. Fails.<br>
“The men-wom thing”, she adds. “you’re either a king or a slut, either the irresistible or repulsion”.<br>
King of a slut, he thinks. Servant of lust.<br>
“She reminds me of my virginity”, he finally speaks.<br>
“Aren’t you married?”, the woman reminds him, her eyebrows heightened.<br>
“Yeah. I mean, I haven’t slept with the victim. I’m Cristal-virgin.”<br><br>
The kitchen is were evil mesmerized last night. Fragments of glass like sharp icebergs and fragments of Cristal’s womanhood can be found even by the blind.<br>
“She was into little kids” reads the woman detective.<br>
A children-maker grooming children, he mumbles.<br>
“The offender-victim started therapy a week ago”, the woman keeps dazzling at it all.<br>
“Well,” he stretches his arms, “it takes an army to be kind. See ya tomorrow.”<br>
“What will you do?” the woman detective asks.<br>
“Jerk off to Cristal, for the last time. Have a cup of tea and watch TV”, but instead he proudly says “Jubilee”.
