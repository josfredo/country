We are used to exploding cars. My mate Anthon found himself in one. At 22 years old, there's only so much left to live for. Raised as an experiment (his mother got carried away by deep sea forever, his father sold items he stole after funerals where over), Anthon lived as a soldier of fate. I would ask him, now and then (well, definitely not now), what was so exciting about an ancient religion. Each time he'd change the subject to Nascar races and the latest Guiness world record. When he was burning he was still like a still life: he was blooming with love.

My work requires skin of steel and absent nerves. Nights of unrelenting expectancy (if not: despair). I deeply yern for the yelling newborn, the twisted metal mistress, the atmosphere of communal involvement at our arrival. Only missing are the pop corns.
I liked my nickname. "The fireman". Anthon gave it to me. I asked him to explain.
"One day you're going to write a memoir. Call it 'Fire, man' [I'm not calling this that] and you be the villain. Yes, the villain of your own story".

Anthon's appearance in the local news was the first of a series of terror acts. The band got caught shortly after their 13th accomplishment. When jury day arrived, so did everyone in town. I mean literally. Security was concerned, so they called us firefighters to help with the issue. I had just finished lunch a couple blocks from there when my boss called, "Emmeth, come back here. There's been aâ€“".

We are used to exploding cars. Every now and then it happens, I guess. Terrorists are so infatuated with their aesthetics, and immigration is at an all-time top. It makes sense.
But we weren't supposed to be used to this ammount of abuse.

Courtroom explosions: 730 dead, 892 injured
January 12, 2031 -  The mayor of Cornsville, Ylienne Mussada, has claimed responsibility for the courtroom explosions, the greatest domestic sinister since 9/11. Neighbour cities are rushing to send aid but Mussada has threatened to "blow people into pieces" if anyone crosses Cornsville's limits, and insisted that her demands be met or "an exponential wave of death will ensue".
Mussada demands the uncensorship of a research paper she says to have published yesterday. The paper, titled "Everything is unrelated", can't be found online at this time.</i>
