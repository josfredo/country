I liked that article titled "Learn programming in ten years". I don't care if starting tomorrow I lose interest in computer stuff. It's unlikely—everything else is lame—but I don't care if I'm wrong. And whatever my social life is at this point, I take it without care. It may be fun, but it's not country so I secretly loathe it.

Today I re-recorded the vocals in <em>Forgive you</em>, which is one of the most iconic songs out of the Krimson Jones catalogue. It always bothered me how the original 2020 vocals sounded so wrong. I attempted to re-record it a few months ago and it just sounded too try-hard. With street noise, an unbothered desk and laptop's microphone, I have now reached honesty.
