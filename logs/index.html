They said "if you're not a programmer, this guide is NOT for you" and then redirected me to a YouTube video of a geek-sized human emotionally manipulating people into liking programming because "it's fun". Fuck all that.<br>
I spent two days writing theories that explain why LRI didn't work IRL. Today I hypothised that the error lies in lack of association. This said, I'm going back to learning whatever the fuck I want, whenever the fuck I want.

Working for what you want is self-sabotage. Goals are a western construct entirely conditioned by a culture of harmful consumption. Everything that sounds exciting is a lie. The truth is always boring.<br>Not to brag, but I've been social media-free for ~a week. This is my longest streak. I don't fucking care that you don't fucking care, for you don't exist. I hate you all.

<em>Tonight: Krimson Jones</em> is really powerful. I read that "coding is like learning an instrument". They are out of their minds. I think you should grab a guitar and mess with it, and that's my approach with coding, I guess (with everything, I guess). Yes, I am not fluent in guitarian. I don't fucking care. Plus, I wanna see some music-theorist come up with Krimson Jones—they can't.

I liked that article titled "Learn programming in ten years". I don't care if starting tomorrow I lose interest in computer stuff. It's unlikely—everything else is lame—but I don't care if I'm wrong. And whatever my social life is at this point, I take it without care. It may be fun, but it's not country so I secretly loathe it.

Today I re-recorded the vocals in <em>Forgive you</em>, which is one of the most iconic songs out of the Krimson Jones catalogue. It always bothered me how the original 2020 vocals sounded so wrong. I attempted to re-record it a few months ago and it just sounded too try-hard. With street noise, an unbothered desk and laptop's microphone, I have now reached honesty.
