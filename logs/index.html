It's funny how scientists and engineers would exagerate about their discoveries, effectively misleading the public, just to make as much money out of them, and they would get backed by the gov and applauded by the public, but as soon as some guy with a funny name starts selling rocks that

Wouldn't it be fun to have everyone indexed? To have eyes all over the place. Sure, you could pay your pretty bills and attend a (one) school, which would translate in a defined and random social circle, which by probability would be utter shit. Or you could know everyone (as much as they share about themselves online, which usually is enough). It of course can be done, the question is how much can it be simplified (lenght and frequency of search).
I'm not talking about searching for people who are already doing stuff. Why would you want to join last? I'm talking about indexing every boring thing. That way, when something appears to fluctuate, we'll be there first.

They said "if you're not a programmer, this guide is NOT for you" and then redirected me to a YouTube video of a geek-sized human emotionally manipulating people into liking programming because "it's fun". Fuck all that.
I spent two days writing theories that explain why LRI didn't work IRL. Today I hypothised that the error lies in lack of association. This said, I'm going back to learning whatever the fuck I want, whenever the fuck I want.

Working for what you want is self-sabotage. Goals are a western construct entirely conditioned by a culture of harmful consumption. Everything that sounds exciting is a lie. The truth is always boring.
Not to brag, but I've been social media-free for ~a week. This is my longest streak. I don't fucking care that you don't fucking care, for you don't exist. I hate you all.

<em>Tonight: Krimson Jones</em> is really powerful. I read that "coding is like learning an instrument". They are out of their minds. I think you should grab a guitar and mess with it, and that's my approach with coding, I guess (with everything, I guess). Yes, I am not fluent in guitarian. I don't fucking care. Plus, I wanna see some music-theorist come up with Krimson Jones—they can't.

I liked that article titled "Learn programming in ten years". I don't care if starting tomorrow I lose interest in computer stuff. It's unlikely—everything else is lame—but I don't care if I'm wrong. And whatever my social life is at this point, I take it without care. It may be fun, but it's not country so I secretly loathe it.

Today I re-recorded the vocals in <em>Forgive you</em>, which is one of the most iconic songs out of the Krimson Jones catalogue. It always bothered me how the original 2020 vocals sounded so wrong. I attempted to re-record it a few months ago and it just sounded too try-hard. With street noise, an unbothered desk and laptop's microphone, I have now reached honesty.
