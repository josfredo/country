I cringe at the idea that I should lower myself into joining already established social groups. If there are like-minded people, then they are competitors and they want me out.
I want to raid the least popular niche and claim it. Invade forgotten territories and annex it to LRI.

<b>Experimental art</b>
Experimental art could be described as "mixing things that don't belong together", as Claudio Palmieri once put it. The output usually feels illegal. I feel that most "experimental artists" fail to grasp this. They would go all-in on weird noises but those already belong together my friend. Where is the morbid pleasure in mixing odd things with odd things?
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>Closed systems, open systems</b>
A closed system is always great. Open systems should be cool, but are impossible by default. Today's "open" systems run as follows: "I AM AMERICA. I OFFER YOU GOD, BUT YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM TO REFUSE. (Y/N)". Open systems are a fallacy.
Closed systems should be taken care of. Any leakage, result of imperfect sealing, will result in aggressive payback from America.
They call it "isolation" when it really is <i>independence</i>.

<b>On AI safety</b>
I dont give a shit about AI safety. This could be considered <i>digital footprint</i> if I were to want to work somewhere relevant, I guess, but thankfully I don’t need to do that. What’s with promoting setting fake profiles as main? How is this not “putin-esque”, to quote the West’s hysteria?
Searching for digital footprint as a countermeasure is like asking a potential schoolshooter if he plans to schoolshoot. Just silly naïve.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>All about web scrapping</b>
At La Rage, we are embarking on a project: to index everyone in town so as to get privileged access to whatever they do before it catches the limelight. I acknowledge that this will easily take months and could very well never get made. Yet I don't care.
"Collection of data on Facebook through automated means is prohibited unless you have express written permission from Facebook" does sound sexy, though.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>Justice for flat-earthers</b>
People would watch high degrees of misinformation every second of their days and then they be like "We should ban flat-earthers from YouTube". I watch flat-earthers and reptilian-believers every time I'm bored. I figured if you're gonna inject yourself with lies (browse YouTube), you may as well do it well.
The enemy (people) would then denounce that "the flat-earther is selling healing rocks". They be rocking their Adidas NEXT-Athlete 3.0, drawing on their iPad CreativityEnhancer+ and sipping their World Peace Edition coffees from Starbucks. God I fucking hate humans.
---------------------------------------------------------
I have a poster of <i>The Social Network</i> in my room. I cut it in half: it says "YOU DON'T GET TO 500 MILLION FRIENDS". The cast keeps getting younger every time I watch it. No wonders Kevin Spacey jumped in as executive producer.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>Fuck people who have jobs</b>
Forget surveilled calls in the name of one's security. Nowadays calls to companies start with "We value your time. Please contact us via WhatsApp to receive a personalized experience [and to save us money]". It continues with the pre-recorded voice listing made-up "common issues" from 1 to 8 so they can put "Talk with a human being" at 9. So far so good, I don't give a fuck since everything's fucked. I have written the procedure for most companies (it looks like 9-8-*type ID*-8-9).
Well today I got redirected to a "virtual assistant" instead of a human being. An extra step. Probably the most undignified of them all, to have to speak "Yes, I have a problem" but dignity is overrated anyways. They took the effort to set up a voice-to-text translator so that you are forced to use your voice. The aim is to dissuade you from even trying. The second aim is to not let you speak to a human operator. If you say stuff like "I have a problem" or "My internet is slow", the machine identifies the keywords and gives you generic troubleshooting suggestions. That's why I always use keywords that have no redirection like "murder" or "death", so the machine is forced to connect me to a human operator. (No, you can't say random words because it will ask you to repeat your query).
What is more baffling than all these crimes against humanity is the amount of empathy that human operators receive. "They are doing their job". Why would they support crime? Because it's legal? Nevermind, everything's fucked. But I found it funny how once, while hanging around with a friend, I was in a call with a human operator and once she gave me my answer I immediately hung up. "Woah, that's so rude", my friend said. "Not cool". Fuck yea, humans.

<b>March 5th</b>
I'm making some stuff and learning lot other. I may delete <i>logs</i>. I was thinking creating (ripping off) a microblog. I dislike structure and that's why I haven't ever daily-diaried. Yet I have had so many blogs with lots of posts that I have forgotten the number. Different blogs for different purposes. I couldn't tell you the truth here (it's dangerous).
I like making unstructured music so much. People be making (yes I'm comparing myself to low scum) music as american-standard as possible, killing off honesty for the sake of a record deal that never comes. I figured I'd learn music production because my songs are that unique, and I want to enjoy them with as much production quality as possible. I'm so motivated because there's nothing to aim for.
Yea I may delete this for a flexible writing space. I dislike the dates. I dislike dates. Who cares what day it is?
---------------------------------------------------------
Wouldn't it be fun to have everyone indexed? To have eyes all over the place. Sure, you could pay your pretty bills and attend a (one) school, which would translate in a defined and random social circle, which by probability would be utter shit. Or you could know everyone (as much as they share about themselves online, which usually is enough). It of course can be done, the question is how much can it be simplified (lenght and frequency of search).
I'm not talking about searching for people who are already doing stuff. Why would you want to join last? I'm talking about indexing every boring thing. That way, when something appears to fluctuate, we'll be there first.

<b>February 28th</b>
They said "if you're not a programmer, this guide is NOT for you" and then redirected me to a YouTube video of a geek-sized human emotionally manipulating people into liking programming because "it's fun". Fuck all that.
I spent two days writing theories that explain why LRI didn't work IRL. Today I hypothised that the error lies in lack of association. This said, I'm going back to learning whatever the fuck I want, whenever the fuck I want.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>February 25th</b>
Working for what you want is self-sabotage. Goals are a western construct entirely conditioned by a culture of harmful consumption. Everything that sounds exciting is a lie. The truth is always boring.
Not to brag, but I've been social media-free for ~a week. This is my longest streak. I don't fucking care that you don't fucking care, for you don't exist. I hate you all.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>February 24th</b>
<em>Tonight: Krimson Jones</em> is really powerful. I read that "coding is like learning an instrument". They are out of their minds. I think you should grab a guitar and mess with it, and that's my approach with coding, I guess (with everything, I guess). Yes, I am not fluent in guitarian. I don't fucking care. Plus, I wanna see some music-theorist come up with Krimson Jones—they can't.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>February 23rd</b>
I liked that article titled "Learn programming in ten years". I don't care if starting tomorrow I lose interest in computer stuff. It's unlikely—everything else is lame—but I don't care if I'm wrong. And whatever my social life is at this point, I take it without care. It may be fun, but it's not country so I secretly loathe it.
---------------------------------------------------------	
<b>February 22nd</b>
Today I re-recorded the vocals in <em>Forgive you</em>, which is one of the most iconic songs out of the Krimson Jones catalogue. It always bothered me how the original 2020 vocals sounded so wrong. I attempted to re-record it a few months ago and it just sounded too try-hard. With street noise, an unbothered desk and laptop's microphone, I have now reached honesty.
