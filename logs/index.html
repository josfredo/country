<b>The path of least resistance</b>
Just maybe, instead of keeping on creating alibis, LRI should follow its natural trend of making music (it's all the rage in La Rage). Yea, I'm extremely biased here, my great album just came out yesterday.
My personal songs (Krimson Jones) are all-caothic and unstructured. I love them. But I understand they are menacing to the average listener. A different flavor of LRI, a new name and new members. This time the stress would be in well-structured songs and after an iconic acoustic demo is done, all hell breaks loose. Meaning, the poppy tunes get satanised, so people are scared but <i>at least they understand</i> that they are scared. Scarring them in their own terms.
---------------------------------------------------------
Three things, I believe: maintenance, scouting, music production. Yea, you could say "biased; you just released a new album". I am always just releasing new albums. One of the constants of my life. I am a shitty music producer. I know, "Jos, IWLUWBS sounds incredible". It does. But most of the time I'm figuring out blindly how to fix frequencies and dynamics so that everything is in its right place. I'd like to produce in an optimized way. I expect to still be a shitty producer at the end of this year and the next. I'd like to master it so that when I'm 30 years old I can move around comfortably. That would be cool. Shit compounds, so they say.
I'd like to improve at certain technicalities so that I can use them on my own creations. I would only help others if they abide to my vision of their artwork. Kind of like how Nigel Godrich saved Radiohead from becoming Coldplay before Coldplay. He literally slapped Thom's demos a million times for a couple hundred eternities. Came back with fucking cool.
---------------------------------------------------------
Once again, a Krimson Jones album is the greatest music piece in the country. The fact of the matter is, absolutely nobody does it the way I do it because everybody is cringe. Everything that I put out reminds me that there's no way I don't end up winning. <i>krimson nation</i> easily the coolest alt-rock tune of the century. <i>this regulator</i> an immediate acoustic classic. <i>i won't let us write bad songs</i> is glorious in its invention and unbeatable at conception.
---------------------------------------------------------
Everybody's worth nothing. The United States of America can destroy the most legendary empires in human history in a blink of an eye. They look alike, though: the thirst for power, the backstabbing practices, the disregard of morality. Thousands of years have not changed that. The USA has better tools, though. Better weapons, better frameworks, better knowledge. It's not who they are what makes the USA impossible to destroy. It's the tools they have. Who they are does not matter, for nobody matters.
---------------------------------------------------------
I hate working for other people. I think it makes sense. If everyone is doing idiotic things and defending idiotic beliefs, it makes sense to hate working for anyone. Isn't everyone's ultimate goal to rent an apartment in Miami, afford the yearly iPhone and go to Disneyland every now and then? My dream is to insulate from the "world" (really The United States Advertising Machine) with a few friends.
---------------------------------------------------------
I have tried the following lots of times. I will try it again, fully knowing it will fail: "A daily logging of the only two projects that I'm supposed to focus on. Daily log, so that I am expected to notify of the progress at the end of the day."
---------------------------------------------------------
In kindergarten we had a box full of toys. Of all toys, the prizest was a red car. At recess, people would rush to the toy box. Whoever got the red car was the coolest kid alive. I never stood a chance.
One holiday I mistakenly assisted. I was the only one in town and finally got to grab the red prize. There was nothing special about the experience.
It was never about the car. The car was a lie and everyone got lied to that it was the coolest thing. Everyone is constantly lied to that this is cool and that is bad and they are good and those are evil.
The car was a lie but the benefits were real. 
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>It's the end of the world, man</b>
I found out about how fucking easy it is to set up an LLM with Ollama. This is wrong. This feels wrong. People who didn't exploit the low internet (old internet) were dumb. But there's no way a dumb person won't be able to access unlimited custom-tuned knowledge. In theory, everyone could make fakes with Photoshop. But nobody did because it was a hassle. This isn't hard. This is easy. This is wrong.
At La Rage we suggested that we could sell these things in USB sticks since it's not mainstream yet to run your own LLM. I'm not bothering advertising things. I'll let it figure itself out. I'm more interested in advancing with the index project. That'll give us a base solid enough upon which we can start investments. It's less darts of hope in the dark and more surrender to the invincible forces of determinism.
---------------------------------------------------------
I haven’t thought about what happens after gathering the data we seek. I think there’s a long way to go until an useful prototype is ready. So I just don't bother. But today at La Rage the question arised. This interesting bit came out: use indexing as leverage.
I'm hesitant about this. It sounds good. Connecting with people is something that LRI is very bad at. But connecting people... Maybe we can pull that off? I don't know. It would depend profoundly on our ability to stalk people, in this case for their own good. And by ability I mean technical knowledge, of course. I have no shortage of drive.
---------------------------------------------------------
At this rate I'm going to learn all songs from OK Computer. They're fun to play. The omnious eastern riffs that Godrich ripped off are hilarious alongside Radiohead's silly sad songs. I always thought Paranoid Android was the hardest possible song to play on an acoustic guitar. That's because when I tried to learn how to play Airbag, the fucking chinese dude from the tutorial said you needed to "change the tunning so it sounds like the record". This meant I would have 0 chances of practicing my favourite Radiohead song, so I never bothered. A couple months ago I decided to figure it out on standard tunning. So yea, I made my own version. It sounds the same. It's so much fun to play. Fuck that guy. And I did the same for Paranoid Android. Literally sounds the same. I don't know if that also "officially" requires a different tunning. I don't fucking care. And today I figured out Subterranian Homesick Alien.
---------------------------------------------------------
I'm watching videos on SQL because it's so fucking confusing. I do grasp the flexibility it offers, though. It makes Excel look cringe. Well, in one video (Harvard lecture, can you imagine?) the example database is a library's. One of the items called my attention. "Die, my love". Ain't that a perfect title? Then I recalled that while most of my days are spent learning, whenever I'm idling it's always HackerNews. I had posponed reading books for when I'm old, but since despite my busy-ness (business? Holy shit) I still have time to read the left-wing links aggregator, I may aswell retake reading.
Also, not related but always related, I wrote a prologue today. It may come to something, it probably won't.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>March 13th</b>
Today marks ~a month since I sort of decided to delve completely into computers.
After a friend of mine succeeding effortlesly in gaining attention, I wrote an entry on my diary titled "Working for the things you want is self-sabotage". It meant stop wanting things. Of course that's impossible for a guy born in the west. But what I got from it was that everything that sounds exciting is a scam, and that the truth is <i>always</i> boring. Excited people and exciting people are scams and scams about to happen, respectively. Don't trust anything unless it's explicitly boring. Emo stuff like that.
The next day Sora came out and I was amazed that something I have thought of (making 15 million dollar budget films by myself) could very well happen in my lifetime. It was nuts. "I don't need people anymore!". The idea of rising technologies giving me total independance from humans was exciting. And this time the goal wasn't people. It was machines (boring). It was a boring excitement!
I came to find out that all that I have read about AI was a lie. This was good. It meant that the truth was boring. I was on the right track.
It's almost silly. I've been around computers my whole life. I've never bothered doing any "coding". I liked doing antisocial mischiefs. Like when, as a kid, I recorded phrases on my computer so that I could press play every time my family called me for dinner and let the speakers do the job. OK computer. Or when I stole people's items in Haboo by making a scam site (no coding required) and copypasting "Unlimited credits, visit my site and enter your credentials" on public rooms until getting banned. More recently it would be stuff like discovering Facebook's hidden advance search in ~2017 (now defunct) and exploiting the shit out of it to stalk people, and using similar not-well-known tools from search engines until exhaustion. Totaly unhealthy behavior, who the fuck cares.
The thought comes, "what could I do if enabled to go further?". It doesn't matter. For all I know, I will leave this inquiry next week. And that'll be fine.
It's almost silly because a month ago I didn't knew 99% of what I am familiar with now.
It's boring, it's lonely, it's perfect for me.
---------------------------------------------------------
I heard someone in the tram say "You're going to become so useless. An useless angel with useless wings".
---------------------------------------------------------
I dreamed of her again. We survived a crime scene, but I asked her to delete everything. Not a very smart move. Police could ask for our phones.
I've dreamed of her so many times that we've developed new inside jokes.
---------------------------------------------------------
It's so cool to stay home on a sunday afternoon stressing over why my code doesn't work. I mean it an honest way. There's something fulfilling about it.
---------------------------------------------------------
I've watched <i>The Social Network</i> at least 8 times in the last 12 months. But what is most alarming is that I've listened to <i>OK Computer</i> thrice this past week. Probably the ony album I can properly hear, because I can fully relate. Even <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> requires a decent state of mind. <i>OK Computer</i> does not.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>Some updates on STK</b>
This thing would try to find us association by giving us privileged access (first access) to promising stuff before it gets any relevancy. From there, two relevant possibilities: woo big fish by leveraging association, woo small fish by leveraging association.
People think you can achieve great things by trying. This is a fallacy. You don't get to choose what you are or what you are not, and there are no transient stages, and there is no "becoming". Everything has been written.
We're literally an STK away from unbridled exclusive access, albeit the parameters will take a huge time (but fun time) to perfect.
---------------------------------------------------------
I cringe at the idea that I should lower myself into joining already established social groups. If there are like-minded people, then they are competitors and they want me out.
I want to raid the least popular niche and claim it. Invade forgotten territories and annex them to LRI.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>Experimental art</b>
Experimental art could be described as "mixing things that don't belong together", as Claudio Palmieri once put it. The output usually feels illegal. I feel that most "experimental artists" fail to grasp this. They would go all-in on weird noises but those already belong together my friend. Where is the morbid pleasure in mixing odd things with odd things?
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>Closed systems, open systems</b>
A closed system is always great. Open systems should be cool, but are impossible by default. Today's "open" systems run as follows: "I AM AMERICA. I OFFER YOU GOD, BUT YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM TO REFUSE. (Y/N)". Open systems are a fallacy.
Closed systems should be taken care of. Any leakage, result of imperfect sealing, will result in aggressive payback from America.
They call it "isolation" when it really is <i>independence</i>.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>On AI safety</b>
I dont give a shit about AI safety. This could be considered <i>digital footprint</i> if I were to want to work somewhere relevant, I guess, but thankfully I don’t need to do that. What’s with promoting setting fake profiles as main? How is this not “putin-esque”, to quote the West’s hysteria?
Searching for digital footprint as a countermeasure is like asking a potential schoolshooter if he plans to schoolshoot. Just silly naïve.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>All about web scrapping</b>
At La Rage, we are embarking on a project: to index everyone in town so as to get privileged access to whatever they do before it catches the limelight. I acknowledge that this will easily take months and could very well never get made. Yet I don't care.
"Collection of data on Facebook through automated means is prohibited unless you have express written permission from Facebook" does sound sexy, though.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>Justice for flat-earthers</b>
People would watch high degrees of misinformation every second of their days and then they be like "We should ban flat-earthers from YouTube". I watch flat-earthers and reptilian-believers every time I'm bored. I figured if you're gonna inject yourself with lies (browse YouTube), you may as well do it well.
The enemy (people) would then denounce that "the flat-earther is selling healing rocks". They be rocking their Adidas NEXT-Athlete 3.0, drawing on their iPad CreativityEnhancer+ and sipping their World Peace Edition coffees from Starbucks. God I fucking hate humans.
---------------------------------------------------------
I have a poster of <i>The Social Network</i> in my room. I cut it in half: it says "YOU DON'T GET TO 500 MILLION FRIENDS". The cast keeps getting younger every time I watch it. No wonders Kevin Spacey jumped in as executive producer.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>Fuck people who have jobs</b>
Forget surveilled calls in the name of one's security. Nowadays calls to companies start with "We value your time. Please contact us via WhatsApp to receive a personalized experience [and to save us money]". It continues with the pre-recorded voice listing made-up "common issues" from 1 to 8 so they can put "Talk with a human being" at 9. So far so good, I don't give a fuck since everything's fucked. I have written the procedure for most companies (it looks like 9-8-*type ID*-8-9).
Well today I got redirected to a "virtual assistant" instead of a human being. An extra step. Probably the most undignified of them all, to have to speak "Yes, I have a problem" but dignity is overrated anyways. They took the effort to set up a voice-to-text translator so that you are forced to use your voice. The aim is to dissuade you from even trying. The second aim is to not let you speak to a human operator. If you say stuff like "I have a problem" or "My internet is slow", the machine identifies the keywords and gives you generic troubleshooting suggestions. That's why I always use keywords that have no redirection like "murder" or "death", so the machine is forced to connect me to a human operator. (No, you can't say random words because it will ask you to repeat your query).
What is more baffling than all these crimes against humanity is the amount of empathy that human operators receive. "They are doing their job". Why would they support crime? Because it's legal? Nevermind, everything's fucked. But I found it funny how once, while hanging around with a friend, I was in a call with a human operator and once she gave me my answer I immediately hung up. "Woah, that's so rude", my friend said. "Not cool". Fuck yea, humans.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>March 5th</b>
I'm making some stuff and learning lot other. I may delete <i>logs</i>. I was thinking creating (ripping off) a microblog. I dislike structure and that's why I haven't ever daily-diaried. Yet I have had so many blogs with lots of posts that I have forgotten the number. Different blogs for different purposes. I couldn't tell you the truth here (it's dangerous).
I like making unstructured music so much. People be making (yes I'm comparing myself to low scum) music as american-standard as possible, killing off honesty for the sake of a record deal that never comes. I figured I'd learn music production because my songs are that unique, and I want to enjoy them with as much production quality as possible. I'm so motivated because there's nothing to aim for.
Yea I may delete this for a flexible writing space. I dislike the dates. I dislike dates. Who cares what day it is?
---------------------------------------------------------
Wouldn't it be fun to have everyone indexed? To have eyes all over the place. Sure, you could pay your pretty bills and attend a (one) school, which would translate in a defined and random social circle, which by probability would be utter shit. Or you could know everyone (as much as they share about themselves online, which usually is enough). It of course can be done, the question is how much can it be simplified (lenght and frequency of search).
I'm not talking about searching for people who are already doing stuff. Why would you want to join last? I'm talking about indexing every boring thing. That way, when something appears to fluctuate, we'll be there first.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>February 28th</b>
They said "if you're not a programmer, this guide is NOT for you" and then redirected me to a YouTube video of a geek-sized human emotionally manipulating people into liking programming because "it's fun". Fuck all that.
I spent two days writing theories that explain why LRI didn't work IRL. Today I hypothised that the error lies in lack of association. This said, I'm going back to learning whatever the fuck I want, whenever the fuck I want.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>February 25th</b>
Working for what you want is self-sabotage. Goals are a western construct entirely conditioned by a culture of harmful consumption. Everything that sounds exciting is a lie. The truth is always boring.
Not to brag, but I've been social media-free for ~a week. This is my longest streak. I don't fucking care that you don't fucking care, for you don't exist. I hate you all.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>February 24th</b>
<em>Tonight: Krimson Jones</em> is really powerful. I read that "coding is like learning an instrument". They are out of their minds. I think you should grab a guitar and mess with it, and that's my approach with coding, I guess (with everything, I guess). Yes, I am not fluent in guitarian. I don't fucking care. Plus, I wanna see some music-theorist come up with Krimson Jones—they can't.
---------------------------------------------------------
<b>February 23rd</b>
I liked that article titled "Learn programming in ten years". I don't care if starting tomorrow I lose interest in computer stuff. It's unlikely—everything else is lame—but I don't care if I'm wrong. And whatever my social life is at this point, I take it without care. It may be fun, but it's not country so I secretly loathe it.
---------------------------------------------------------	
<b>February 22nd</b>
Today I re-recorded the vocals in <em>Forgive you</em>, which is one of the most iconic songs out of the Krimson Jones catalogue. It always bothered me how the original 2020 vocals sounded so wrong. I attempted to re-record it a few months ago and it just sounded too try-hard. With street noise, an unbothered desk and laptop's microphone, I have now reached honesty.
