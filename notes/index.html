	<br><br><em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (abelson, 1996)</em><br>
	>Well-designed computational systems, like well-designed automobiles or nuclear reactors, are designed in a modular manner, so that the parts can be constructed, replaced, and debugged separately.<br>
	>The general form of a procedure definition is: (define ([name] [formal parameters]) [body]).

	<br><br><em>on the measure of intelligence (chollet, 2019)</em><br>
 	>friedberg (1958) said to build a truly intelligent machine, you either reduce all skills into exact sciences "or we must develop a machine that can do things without being told precisely how".<br>
 	>"the field of artificial intelligence has been very successful in developing artificial systems that perform these tasks without featuring intelligence" (hernandez-orallo, 2017). chollet says this trend still continues.<br>
 	>"AI's focus on achieving task-specific performance while placing no conditions on how the system arrives at this performance has led to systems that, despite performing the target tasks well, largely do not feature the sort of human intelligence that the field of AI set out to build."<br>
 	>"As humans, we can only display high skill at a specific task if we have the ability to efficiently acquire skills in general, which corresponds to intelligence" ///ouch<br>
